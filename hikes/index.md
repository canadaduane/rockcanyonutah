# Squaw Peak Hike

<div class="pure-g">
    <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-2-5">
        Squaw Peak
        <br>Ele­va­tion: 7,877
        <br>Loca­tion: Wasatch Range, Utah
    <p>
        Per­haps the most pop­u­lar smaller peak in Utah County is Squaw Peak, at the mouth of Rock Canyon (just above the Provo Tem­ple and the Mis­sion­ary Train­ing Cen­ter). From the west you can see Squaw gen­tly ris­ing from north to south, but the south side drops abruptly to the canyon bot­tom, cre­at­ing a fero­cious south face.

        Take the trail which heads up Rock Canyon (which is paved for the first bit).You will cross five bridges and then con­tinue about ¼ mile until you see the Squaw Peak Trail rock on the left (north).  Take a good look at the photo of the rock with the words “Squaw Peak Trail” engraved on it.  That’s your trail marker!

    <p>
        As you make your way to the north, you’ll have a fine view of Mt. Tim­pano­gos. The trail turns and gets steeper as you fin­ish the climb to the sum­mit, where you are greeted with an impres­sive view back down to the Rock Canyon trail­head, nearly 3,000 feet straight down! Take in nearly-360-degree views on Squaw Peak (7,876 ft.) from which you can see Utah Lake, Tim­pano­gos and Provo Peak, a sel­dom vis­ited 11,000 foot peak.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tak­ing this route up Squaw Peak is approx­i­mately three miles each way from the main Rock Canyon trail, climb­ing about 3,000 feet total. Expect round-trip hik­ing times of three to four hours from the trail­head park­ing lot.

# Five Peaks (back side of Rock Canyon)

<div class="pure-g">
    <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-2-5">
        <b>Cascade Mountain</b>
        <br>Ele­va­tion: 10,908 feet
        <br>Loca­tion: Wasatch Range, Utah
    <p>
        This is the large moun­tain south of Provo Canyon. It has four seper­ate peaks along its sum­mit ridge. The south sum­mit is 147 feet lower than the actual sum­mit. This is con­sid­ered one of the harder peaks in the Wasatch because there is really no easy way to the top. The first thing that is notice­able about Cas­cade Moun­tain is that there are sev­eral steep couloirs run­ning down its west face. These couloirs make excel­lent spring snow climbs. There are two routes that hik­ers gen­er­ally use. The Bun­nels Fork route is prob­a­bly the most scenic. It is still a long day with over 5,000 feet of ele­va­tion gain. The sec­ond route is the south ridge from Dry Fork trail­head on Squaw Peak Road. The north­east ridge is another pos­si­bil­ity, but this would be a very long day.

        <b>Light­ning Peak</b>
        <br>Ele­va­tion: 10,056 feet
        <br>Loca­tion: Wasatch Range, Utah
    <p>
        Light­ning Peak is located on the ridge­line north­east of Shin­gle Mill Peak. The Great West­ern Trail pro­vides access to this peak. Also Shin­gle Mill Canyon or Water Hol­low can be hiked from the South Fork of Provo Canyon. The trail climbs to a high moun­tain ridge­line called Windy Pass. Light­ning Peak will be directly west of the pass. You can also climb Light­ning Peak from the Dry Fork Trail­head on Squaw Peak Road. This would be a long day hike. The moun­tain can be seen in the dis­tance above many of the smaller peaks near Big Springs Hol­low to the northwest.

        <br>Loca­tion: Wasatch Range, Utah
    <p>
        Shin­gle Mill Peak is located north of Free­dom Peak on the same ridge­line. The stan­dard route for climb­ing the moun­tain is from the Dry Fork Trail­head on Squaw Peak Road. The moun­tain has lines of ter­races run­ning across its slopes. The trail tra­verses these ter­races until it gets to the sad­dle with Shin­gle Mill Peak and Free­dom Peak. Now all you have to do is fol­low the ridge up to the sum­mit. The last part is steep but not dif­fi­cult. You might as well climb Free­dom Peak while you are there. Shin­gle Mill Peak can also be reached from Big Springs Trail. The dis­tance from the park­ing lot to the Cas­cade sad­dle is just over 5 miles. The route from the Big Springs trail is longer than the route from Dry Fork.

        <b>Freedom Peak</b>
        <br>Ele­va­tion: 10,801 feet
        <br>Loca­tion: Wasatch Range, Utah
    <p>
        This moun­tain was offi­cially named on June 9, 2005. One of the largest Inde­pen­dence Day cel­e­bra­tions, The Free­dom Fes­ti­val, takes place in Provo. No doubt this had influ­ence on vot­ing to name it Free­dom Peak. It is located on the ridge­line north of Provo Peak. The short­est route to the top is from the Dry Fork Trail­head on Squaw Peak Road. This is the same approach for Shin­gle Mill Peak which you could eas­ily com­bine with Free­dom Peak. The final part up the moun­tain has some nice scram­bling along the ridge­line. You can also con­tinue on the ridge toward Provo Peak.

        <br>Ele­va­tion: 11,044 feet
        <br>Loca­tion: Wasatch Range, Utah
    <p>
        East Provo Peak is located to the east of Provo Peak. It is only twenty-four feet lower and climbed less often than Provo Peak. They are con­nected by a ridge­line and a sad­dle. To tra­verse this ridge you will lose ele­va­tion before climb­ing up to the sum­mit. This is a steep hike that has some loose rock. East Provo has enough promi­nence to qual­ify as a sep­a­rate peak. It is climbed by peo­ple wish­ing to com­plete the Wasatch Eleven­ers. East Provo Peak can also be reached by a long ridge hike from Free­dom Peak far­ther north. This route is usu­ally accessed from Squaw Peak Road.

        <br>Loca­tion: Wasatch Range, Utah
    <p>
        Provo Peak is one of the high­est moun­tains above the city of Provo. The route used the most is the west ridge. The trail­head for the west ridge starts from Squaw Peak Road. This road is paved to Rock Creek Camp­ground and then turns into a gravel dirt road after that. The route is dif­fi­cult to find at the begin­ning. You’ll be walk­ing up steep slopes and along ter­races. Once you get to the ridge­line the trail will be easy to see and fol­low. You can also get there from the Dry Fork Trail­head by tak­ing the same route to Free­dom Peak and con­tin­u­ing south along the ridge.
